# Stack Up 
**Stack Up** is a game where you place blocks one on top of another until the block slices down to zero. It is a 2D-rendered 3D game, and I have tried creating it using JavaScript, Python, and C++, applying the same concept in each language.

### Clone this project
```
git clone https://github.com/JunaithSM/StackUp.git
```

## **JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS**  
I used the `HTMLCanvasElement` to create this game with JavaScript for rendering and logic.  
High scores are stored using `window.localStorage`.  

To view the game:  
1. Navigate to the `javascript/` folder.  
2. Open the `index.html` file in a browser to see the program in action.  

## **Python**  
I developed this version using `Pygame` for rendering and gameplay mechanics.  
High scores are stored in a `.csv` file for easy data management.  

To run the game:  
1. Install Pygame using:  
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```  
2. Execute the game script:  
   ```bash
   python game.py
   ```  

---

## **C++**  
I created this version using the `SDL2` library for rendering and handling game logic.  
High scores are saved in a `.txt` file.  

To run the game:  
1. Execute the application:  
   ```bash
   ./app.exe
   ```  

I know I didn't compeletly finish the `C++` program but the game is finsihed.
